Our nation's economy heavily depends on agriculture. Providing food for everyone is becoming a significant problem as the human population grows every day. This project has been prepared as an effort to reassess the research studies on the relevance of machine learning techniques in the domain of agricultural crop production.Agricultural yield depends on various factors such as rainfall,humidity,soil, pesticides, etc. In olden days,farmers were able to anticipate crop yields from their past experience, but now-a- days it's harder since the environment is changing in an unforeseen way.This Proposed system uses machine learning techniques like decision tree regressor, KNN (k nearest neighbors), and naive bayes and creates a trained model to find trends in the data, which in turn can be used to predict crop yield.This system obtains approximately 96% accuracy in predicting the crop yield. An accurate crop yield model can help farmers decide what to grow and when to grow it.
